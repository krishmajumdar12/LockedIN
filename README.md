## How to Use

1. Click the **LockedIN** icon in your toolbar to open the popup.

2. Under the **Block Websites** section, add any websites you want to restrict during focus time.
   - Format: just the domain (e.g. `youtube.com`, `instagram.com`)
   - You can remove sites from the list at any time using the ‚ùå button.

3. Click the **"Start Focus Mode"** button to begin a **25-minute session** (session cannot be ended once started until timer expires).
   - A countdown timer will appear in the popup.
   - The **Start** button becomes disabled to prevent early exit.

4. While focus mode is active:
   - Any tab that matches a blocked site will be covered by a fullscreen overlay reminding you to stay focused.
   - You can still browse other (non-blocked) sites freely.

5. Once the timer reaches zero:
   - Focus mode will automatically end.
   - The overlay disappears (refresh if needed).
   - You can start another session whenever you're ready.
